### Project Goal:
1. Determine bounding boxes for devices in images using YOLOv8
2. Crop and pad dataset images using YOLOv8 bounding boxes
3. Create image similarity model with vision transformers
4. Compile all processes into image search tool pipeline

### Related Area:
Machine learning
Computer Vision
Telecommunications

### Business Impact:
An image based search algorithm has several positive potential applications.
Can be used to improve customer service by providing better image recognition for customer inquiries or issues.
Can be used for targeted advertising by analyzing visual content preferences of users.
The analysis of visual data using similarity algorithms can provide valuable insights into customer behavior, preferences, and trends, enabling data-driven decision-making for business strategies.

### Resources:
